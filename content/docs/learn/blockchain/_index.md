# Blockchain

## What is a Blockchain?

The term "Blockchain" is derived from how digital blocks are cryptographically chained together. Stripping away other auxiliary features, the blockchain data structure consists fundamentally of 2 elements; the block and the chain. _A block can be thought of as a collated list of transactions_ like tasks to do on a to-do list.

Each transaction is initiated by someone with the purpose of achieving a particular outcome. For example, Alice (the initiator) wants to lend 5 bucks to Bob i.e. the wallet balances of Alice and Bob should decrease and increase by 5 respectively (desired outcome) once this transaction has completed.

On the other hand, the "chain" is what connects these blocks together.

## Understanding how the "chain" works

By leveraging on cryptography and some smart design choices, _the "chain" is able to automatically, immediately and instantly propagate any changes (be it genuine, malicious or unintended) from an earlier block to the latest block_! This allows users to easily monitor for changes to the blockchain simply by watching the latest block instead of combing the entire chain. Talk about optimisation!

The cryptographic algorithm behind this is known as _hashing_ and the "smart design choices" pertains to how _blocks are linked through their headers_.

### Hashing

Without going too [in depth](advanced_topics/hashing.md), _hashing is the act of using a hash function on an input_. A hash function takes in an arbitrary length input and returns a fixed length output. This output is commonly referred to as the hash value or a digest.

{{< figure src="/hashing_fox_example.svg" alt="Hashing the word 'Fox' with a SHA-1 hash function" caption="Hashing the word 'Fox' with a SHA-1 hash function" >}}

In the example above, a SHA-1 hash function is used to hash the word `Fox` and the corresponding hash value `DFCD 3454 BBEA 788A 751A 696C 24D9 7009 CA99 2D17` is generated.

One of the many properties of good hash functions is that _a small change to the input should return an output that appears completely uncorrelated to the previous output_. This is also known as the [avalanche effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect).

{{< figure src="/hashing_avalanche_effect_example.svg" alt="Avalanche effect in hashing algorithms" caption="Avalanche effect in hashing algorithms" >}}

By replacing the character `v` with the character `u` in the word `over`, the SHA-1 hash function returns a seemingly unrelated output. You can try out some of these hash functions yourself [here](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha1.html)!

### Block Headers

A block is defined earlier as "a collated list of transactions" which is not entirely wrong but not quite correct either. _A block also contains a header which is where other information associated to this block is stored_. The block header should contain the following at minimum:

1. previous block hash
2. timestamp of when the block is mined
3. a nonce value

For the purpose of this explanation, you only need to understand the first parameter. A _block hash is the output generated by hashing the contents of an entire block_ i.e.

```javascript
// Formula: hash(input) = output
// input = block, output = block hash
// block can be further deconstructed into block header & list of transactions
// hence hash(block header & list of transactions) = block hash
```

The parameter `previous block hash` is therefore referencing the block hash generated by hashing the previous block!

{{< figure src="/block_with_header.png" alt="A block with its block header" caption="A block with its block header" >}}

The block above has a block hash of `0x328ac0f2...`. This hash is computed by hashing together the block header (containing the previous block header `0xe732e3c9`) and the list of transactions.

## Modifications to a blockchain

Putting the aforementioned points together, a blockchain looks something like this...

{{< figure src="/chain_of_blocks_with_header.png" alt="An example of a chain of blocks connected via their block headers" caption="An example of a chain of blocks connected via their block headers"  >}}

It might not be entirely evident as to how the "chain" is able to achieve the automatic, immediate and instant propagation any changes to the latest block so let us illustrate this with an example. Imagine that you have a blockchain with 4 blocks (just like in the diagram above).

{{< figure src="/chain_of_blocks_with_modifications.png" alt="A blockchain that has been maliciously modified" caption="A blockchain that has been maliciously modified"  >}}

If a malicious actor were to modify a transaction in the list of transactions in block 1, the hash of the block 1 will change. Since this hash is referenced in the header of the block 2, changing the hash of block 1 will in turn modify the hash of block 2. This is repeated again in block 3 and so on until the latest block!

### A caveat behind the blockchain data structure

Astute readers will notice that while users can easily tell whether 2 blockchains are the same by comparing the hash of the latest block, they will not be able to detect which block the divergence started from. This is solved through the consensus mechanism of the blockchain but it is out of the scope of this explanation. You can read more about it [here](advanced_topics/consensus_algorithms.md).

## Summary

Now that you have a better grasp of the blockchain data structure, let us move on to the section about [properties of a blockchain](properties.md).
