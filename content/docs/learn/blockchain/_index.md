# Blockchain

## What is a Blockchain?

The term "Blockchain" is derived from how digital blocks are cryptographically chained together. Stripping away other auxiliary features, the blockchain data structure consists fundamentally of 2 elements; the block and the chain. _A block can be thought of as a collated list of transactions_ like tasks to do on a to-do list.

Each transaction is initiated by someone with the purpose of achieving some desired outcome. For example, Alice (the initiator) wants to lend 5 bucks to Bob i.e. the wallet balances of Alice and Bob should decrease and increase by 5 respectively (desired outcome) once this transaction has completed.

Unfortunately, blocks by themselves are not very interesting but by leveraging on cryptography and some smart design choices, _the "chain" that connects these blocks is able to automatically, immediately and instantly propagate any changes (be it genuine, malicious or unintended) from an earlier block to the latest block_!

This means that users are now able to detect if an earlier block has been modified without having to comb through the entire chain! Talk about optimisation!

## Understanding how the "chain" works

The "chain" is described earlier as "cryptography and some smart design choices". The cryptographic algorithm behind the enhanced functionality provided by the "chain" is known as _hashing_.

### Hashing

Without going too in depth, _hashing is the act of using a hash function on some input_. The hash function takes in an arbitrary length value and returns a fixed number of characters. This output is commonly referred to as the hash value or digest.

![an example of hashing the string Fox with a SHA1 hash function](/hashing_example_1.svg)

For example, the word `Fox` when hashed with a `SHA-1` hash function, generates the output `DFCD 3454 BBEA 788A 751A 696C 24D9 7009 CA99 2D17`.

A defining feature of good hash functions is that _a small change to the input should return an output that appears completely uncorrelated to the previous output_.

![an example of a completely uncorrelated output by changing 1 character in input](/hashing_example_2.svg)

By replacing the character `v` with the character `u` in the word `over`, the hash function returns a seemingly unrelated output.

### Block Headers

A block is defined earlier as "a collated list of transactions" which is not entirely wrong but not 100% correct either. _A block also contains a block header which is where you store other information related to this block_. At minimum, it should contain the following:

1. hash value of the previous block
2. timestamp of when the block is mined
3. a nonce value

For the purpose of this explanation, we can just focus on the first parameter (hash value of the previous block). The output generated by hashing any block (hereinafter referred to as _block hash_) is generated by passing in the entire block as input into a hash function i.e.

```javascript
// Formula: hash(input) = output
// input = block, output = block hash
// block can be further deconstructed into block header & list of transactions
// therefore hash(block header & list of transactions) = block hash
```
The field "output of the hash of the previous block" is therefore referring to the block hash of the previous block. This is equivalent to the output generated by hashing the previous block.

In the example block above, this block has a block hash value of (`0x328ac0f2...`) which is computed by hashing together the previous block header (`0xe732e3c9`) and the list of transactions.

### Putting it all together
