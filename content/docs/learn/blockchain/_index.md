# Blockchain

## What is a Blockchain?

The term "Blockchain" is derived from how digital blocks are cryptographically chained together. Stripping away other auxiliary features, the blockchain data structure consists fundamentally of 2 elements; the block and the chain. _A block can be thought of as a collated list of transactions_, just like tasks on a to-do list.

Each transaction is initiated by someone with the purpose of achieving a particular outcome. For example, Alice (the initiator) wants to lend 5 bucks to Bob i.e. the wallet balances of Alice and Bob should decrease and increase by 5 respectively (desired outcome) once this transaction has completed.

While a block represents an aggregated list of actions, _the "chain" is what connects these blocks together_.

{{< figure src="/chain_of_blocks.png" alt="A 'chain' of blocks" caption="A 'chain' of blocks" >}}

Moreover, _this chain also provides the additional functionality of automatically, immediately and instantly propagate any modifications (be it genuine, malicious or unintended) from an earlier block to the latest block_!

## Understanding how the "chain" works

The “propagation of changes” effect is achieved by leveraging on cryptography and some smart design choices. The cryptographic algorithm behind this is known as _hashing_ and the "smart design choices" pertains to how _blocks are linked through their headers_.

### Hashing

Without going too [in depth](advanced_topics/hashing.md), _hashing is the act of using a hash function on an input_. A hash function takes in an arbitrary length input and returns a fixed length output. This output is commonly referred to as the hash value or a digest.

{{< figure src="/hashing_fox_example.svg" alt="Hashing the word 'Fox' with a SHA-1 hash function" caption="Hashing the word 'Fox' with a SHA-1 hash function" >}}

In the example above, a SHA-1 hash function is used to hash the word `Fox` and the corresponding hash value `DFCD 3454 BBEA 788A 751A 696C 24D9 7009 CA99 2D17` is generated.

One of the many properties of a good hash function is that a small change to the input should return an output that appears completely uncorrelated to the previous output. This is also known as the [avalanche effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect).

{{< figure src="/hashing_avalanche_effect_example.svg" alt="Avalanche effect in hashing algorithms" caption="Avalanche effect in hashing algorithms" >}}

By replacing the character `v` with the character `u` in the word `over`, the SHA-1 hash function returns a seemingly unrelated output. You can try out some of these hash functions [here](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha1.html)!

### Block Headers

A block is defined earlier as "a collated list of transactions" which is not entirely wrong but not quite correct either. _A block also contains a header which is where other information associated to this block is stored_ and should contain, at minimum, the following:

1. previous block hash
2. timestamp of when the block is mined
3. a nonce value

For the purpose of this explanation, you can just focus on the first parameter. The parameter `previous block hash` is literally what it means; the block hash of previous block. A _block hash is the output generated by hashing the contents of an entire block_.

{{< figure src="/block_with_header.png" alt="A block with its block header" caption="A block with its block header" >}}

The block above has a block hash of `0x328ac0f2...`. This hash is computed by hashing together the block header (containing the previous block header `0xe732e3c9`) and the list of transactions.

### Modifications to a blockchain

Putting the aforementioned points together, a blockchain looks something like this...

{{< figure src="/chain_of_blocks_with_header.png" alt="An example of a chain of blocks connected via their block headers" caption="An example of a chain of blocks connected via their block headers"  >}}

Now imagine that the above blockchain has been tampered with.

< Insert the same image as above but with a red highlight on the list of transactions.>

A malicious actor has modified a transaction in the list of transactions in block 1. Since a block hash is generated by hashing the block header and the list of transactions, modifying the list of transactions will generate a brand new block hash for block 1.

{{< figure src="/chain_of_blocks_with_modifications.png" alt="A blockchain that has been maliciously modified" caption="A blockchain that has been maliciously modified"  >}}

Since this hash is referenced in the header of the block 2, changing the hash of block 1 will in turn modify the hash of block 2. This is repeated again in block 3 and so on until the latest block!

### Caveats to note

Astute readers will notice that while comparing 2 blockchains, it is trivial to tell that they are different by comparing the latest block hash however it is not possible to determine 2 things:

1. Which blockchain is the modified blockchain (from the perspective of one blockchain, the other blockchain is modified)
2. From which block the divergence occured from

These problems are solved through the consensus mechanism of the blockchain e.g. Nakamoto consensus / PBFT but it is out of the scope of this explanation.

## Summary

The blockchain data structure is effectively a collated list of transactions that are represented as blocks and each block is linked to the next block via the block header. The application of hashing to this design enables changes made to earlier blocks to be propagated to the latest block. This means that users do not have to comb the entire blockchain to determine if the blockchain has been modified. Talk about optimisation!

That said however, there are some caveats that you should be aware of e.g. just because you can tell whether a blockchain has been altered does not mean that you know which blockchain is the altered blockchain (or which is the "true" blockchain) and that you will not be able to tell where the blockchain was altered from.

Now that you have a better grasp of the blockchain data structure, let us learn about the [properties of a blockchain](properties.md) to understand how blockchain differs from other types of ledgers (databases)!
