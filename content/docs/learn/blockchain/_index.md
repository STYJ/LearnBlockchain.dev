# Blockchain
## What is a Blockchain?
The term "Blockchain" is derived from how digital blocks are cryptographically chained together. Stripping away other auxiliary features, the blockchain data structure consists fundamentally of 2 elements; the blocks and the chain. A block can be thought of as a collated list of tasks to be performed by an individual.

However, blocks by themselves are not very cool since it only aggregate actions into a single unit. By leveraging on cryptography and some smart design choices, the "chain" that connects these blocks elevates this blocks data structure to a whole new level! Any malicious or unintended changes to previous blocks will automatically be propagated down to the last block so it becomes immediately evident if someone tries to tamper with past transactions.
