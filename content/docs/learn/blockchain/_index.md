# Explain blockchain in 5 steps 
1. Imagine that you run a company that accept random miscellaneous jobs:
   - help jane to transfer money to john
   - do some groceries for mom
   - cook dinner for bob
   - 
2. Create a physical representation for each task e.g. 1 task = 1 card 
   <insert image of 3 cards>
3. Everytime you complete a task, put the card into a box. Today I completed 3 tasks.
      
4. Tie the box with an unbreakable magic string

5. Ask your friend to repeat steps 1 - 4 for another set of tasks

6. "Connect" the first box and the second box with another unbreakable magic string.

Voilà! You just created a blockchain.
